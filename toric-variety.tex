\section{The Toric Variety}

We consider the space of weights $\mathbb C^{12} = \{(\beta_{i},\alpha_{jk})\mid 1\leq i,j,k\leq 3\}$ and the space of transition rates $\mathbb C^{24} = \{(F_{xy}) \mid x,y \text{ binary states differing at one bit}\}$. We have a map
$f\colon \mathbb C^{12}\to \mathbb C^{24}$ \annotation{defined how?}. We define the toric variety $X$ as the Zariski closure of the image of $f$.

\begin{calculation}
The variety $X$ has dimension $12$ and degree $216$. This can be directly calculated after finding the ideal of $X$ via elimination of variables. \annotation{better: use PolyMake to take advantage of the toric structure}
\end{calculation}
